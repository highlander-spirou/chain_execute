# Chain Execution Library: Simplifying Complex Program Flow

This repository houses a powerful tool designed to streamline the execution of complex programs by organizing sequential functions into a `Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)` using `NetworkX`. If you've ever found yourself grappling with convoluted dependencies between functions, struggling to maintain readability and coherence in your codebase, this library is here to help.

## Purpose and Scope

The primary goal of this library is to simplify the orchestration of functions within a program, especially in scenarios where functions have intricate dependencies. Often, as projects grow in complexity, managing these dependencies becomes a daunting task, leading to code that is difficult to understand, debug, and maintain. By leveraging the structure of a DAG, this library offers a systematic approach to managing function execution order, reducing clutter and enhancing clarity in your code.

## Learning Tool
Beyond its practical applications, this project serves as an invaluable learning tool for software developers at various stages of their journey. Here are some key learning objectives this project aims to address:

âœ… Package Development in Python: Gain hands-on experience in developing Python packages, complete with proper testing, changelog management, code documentation, and version control.

âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: Explore OOP concepts and best practices while working with interfaces, types, and other object-oriented design patterns.

âœ… Working with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs): Develop a deeper understanding of DAGs and their role in modeling dependencies and optimizing program flow.

âœ… Solid Software Development Mindset: Cultivate essential skills and habits of effective software developers, including modular design, code organization, and continuous improvement.

## Implementation Details
The library features comprehensive code documentation and strict typing to enhance readability and maintainability for VSCode users. 

For a closer look at the library's functionality, I recommend exploring the `tests` folder, where you'll find comprehensive test cases demonstrating various aspects of the library's behavior. Additionally, feel free to dive into the source code to gain insights into how the library leverages NetworkX to construct and traverse DAGs, orchestrating the execution of functions in a systematic and efficient manner.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
