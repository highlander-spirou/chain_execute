# A chain execution library

This library's purpose is to make complex program (where functions are depend with each other in an ugly manners) easy by binding sequential functions into a Directed Acyclic Graph using Networkx.

This project is served as a learning tool:

✅ Develop a package in Python with proper test, Changelog management, Code docs and version control

✅ Works with OOP, Interfaces, Types, ...

✅ Working with DAGs

✅ Implement a solid mindset of a software developer

## Implementation

The code contains code docs abd strict-type which would be feasible to work if working with VSCode. However, please view the implementation in the [./tests] folder to know more about the library's behaviour.
